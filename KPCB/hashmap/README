This README contains instructions on how to compile and execute my programs.
================================================================================

To compile and run the hashmap program, simple navigate into the hashmap directory
and run make. Then run the hashmap executable
(e.g. ./hashmap or ./hashmap 10000)

The hashmap program can either take no arguments or one argument. If provided
one argument, it will create a hashmap of that size. Otherwise, it will use
the default size as defined in the header file.

The main method in hashmap.cpp runs tests the hashmap's set, get, delete, and load
functions, and also provides runtime performance. The test functions are included
in hashmap.h/hashmap.cpp, and operate under the assumption that the hashmap
contains string/string key/value pairs.
